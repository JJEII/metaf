# metaf
metaf is a powerful meta/nav editor in an alternate format from that used by the VirindiTank addon to the MMORPG game Asheron's Call. metaf provides full-featured capabilities for editing, and very straightforward bidirectional translation between .met/.nav and .af, with VirindiTank still running the end results. Requires .NET Core. Notepad++ strongly recommended.
